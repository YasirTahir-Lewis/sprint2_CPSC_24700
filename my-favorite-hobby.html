    <h1>Assignment: My Favorite Hobby</h1>
    <h2>Version 1</h2>
    <h3>I have a lot of different hobbies including: </h3>

    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>Programming/Coding</li>
        <li>Flying</li>
        <li>Traveling</li>
        <li>Watching movies/TV shows</li>
        <li>Playing video games</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <p>I love coding. I started programming as a hobby when I was 15. My uncle was a computer engineer so he encouraged me to go into IT field, he also showed me how to learn different computer languages and how to make webpages and application etc. Since
        I was a kid I have wanted to go in CS field and explore a lot but when I grew up I changed my mind to become a commercial Pilot.</p>

    <p>I went to a local flying school near my house and started taking flying training on a small Cessan 172 but after I got my first Private Pilot licence I realized it is a lot harder than I thought and it needs a lot of commitment and on top of that
        it was also very expensive carrier so I switched to CS field and now I working to towards my CS degree to become a Software developer or Data Scientist one day.</p>

    <p>My proudest moment was of course the day when I finally cleared my checkride and got my Private Pilot Licence.</p>

    <p>I think for some one who would like to get started with this hobby can definetily get a short flight with a certified instructor it's called "Discovery flight" to see if you like flying and persue this as a passion, hobbby or even full time career.

    <p>I love to travel to new places and explore different cultures and their practices. It makes me feel that I have accomplish something in life and explore different ways to live my life. By the way I love Japanese culture and their lifestyle. I have
        never been to Japan but I really want to go their one day.</p>

    <p>I love bing watching netflix on a weekend night with my buddies and eating snacks. It's a time in my life when I forget all of my problems and life and just be in that moment. I think we all should have more time like this in our daily routine.
    </p>

    <p>I am a big fan of video games, I have played Call of duty, fortnite, GTA, FIFA, Sonic, Counter Strike, Walking dead, Need for speed, God of War, The last of us and so many more.</p>
